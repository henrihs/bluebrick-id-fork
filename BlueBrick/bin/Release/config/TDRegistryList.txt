; This config file is used to list all the different Track Designer Registry that the AFOL Community may have used in the World.
; All these custom registry may not be compatible between each other because they may use different part ID for describing the same part.
; However, BlueBrick can support several Registry during the loading of a TDL file, but it will use the current Registry
; set on your machine during the saving of a TDL file in order to decide which ID should be used.
; The TDL file saved on your machine with BlueBrick is then intended to be load in TrackDesigner with the same Registry.
;
; This config file allow you to associate a TDR filename (Track Designer Registry file) with a string keyword.
; This keyword can then be used in the XML description files of the BlueBrick part library to specify the ID used in one
; particular registry file. Please read the BlueBRick help file for more information on the XML Format.
;
; The format for this config file is: <keyword>=<TDRFilename> without space around "="
; The keyword can not contains blank characters (no space, no tab), file name can contains space.
; The "default" keyword is reserved for the default registry.
; Only one registry per line, blanck lines and lines starting with a semicolon are ignored.
